# Julifsp
An extensible toolkit for [Finite State Projection](https://www.atmos.colostate.edu/~munsky/Papers/JChemPhys_124_044104.pdf) analysis of Stochastic Reaction Network models in Julia. 
## Features 
This package aims to offer dynamic, fast, and customizable methods for direct numerical integration of the Chemical Master Equation (CME) in Julia. Currently, it has:
- Transient solution of the CME for time-homogeneous reaction rates/propensities as well as time-varying reaction rates/propensities using Finite State Projection and related variants.
- Dynamic state spaces: The truncated state space is adapted on-the-fly to remove redundant states with low probabilities and add more states to ensure the truncation error is within user-specified tolerance.
- Customizable: Users can choose how the dynamic state space is managed and how the reduced ODEs are solved by the multitude options offered by [`DifferentialEquations.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl).
- Sensitivity analysis and automatic differentiation: Compute partial derivatives of the FSP solution with respect to model parameters. Users do not need to write analytic expressions of the propensity's partial derivatives. Instead, the package applies existing tools from [`SparsityDetection.jl`](https://github.com/SciML/SparsityDetection.jl) and [`ForwardDiff.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaDiff/ForwardDiff.jl) to generate those derivatives automatically.
- Advanced users can write their own dynamic state space management policy by subtyping `SpaceAdapter`.
## TODO
- [ ] Tutorials.
- [ ] User-friendly model input by integration with `Catalyst.jl`.
- [ ] Implement more state space adaptation policy:
    - [Sliding windows](https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-0509-4-42).
    - [SSA-driven state space](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2015.08.010).
    - [Multi-finite buffer](http://gila.bioe.uic.edu/lab/papers/2016/ACME-CaoTerebusLiang-2016.pdf).
- [ ] Implement [methods](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4994917) based on Tensor-train approximations.
- [ ] [Stationary FSP](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29055349/).
- [ ] User-friendly support for computing the [Fisher Information Matrix](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006365) and optimal experiment design.
## Related packages
- [`FiniteStateProjection.jl`](https://github.com/kaandocal/FiniteStateProjection.jl) written by Kaan Ã–cal offers methods to convert a `Catalyst.jl` reaction network into a `ModelingToolkitize`'d FSP system (on a hyper-rectangular truncated state space) that can be solved using `DifferentialEquations.jl`. The package also automatically detects subnetworks with mass conservation (e.g. `A <->B` reactions) to reduce state dimension (this is also done automatically by `Julifsp`'s sparse exploration method by exploring only states reachable from the support of the initial distribution).
